Shairport Sync
=============
* Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player â€“ it plays audio streamed from Apple devices and from AirPlay sources such as [OwnTone](https://github.com/owntone/owntone-server) (formerly `forked-daapd`).
* Shairport Sync can provide "classic" AirPlay 1 or limited Airplay 2 support. The AirPlay 2 build is much more demanding. It requires a faster system, more storage and more RAM both at build time and run time.
* Shairport Sync does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.
