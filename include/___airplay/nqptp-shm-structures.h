#define NQPTP_SHM_STRUCTURES_VERSION 7
#define NQPTP_CONTROL_PORT 9000

// The control port expects a UDP packet with the first space-delimited string
// being the name of the shared memory interface (SMI) to be used.
// This allows client applications to have a dedicated named SMI interface with
// a timing peer list independent of other clients.
// The name given must be a valid SMI name and must contain no spaces.
// If the named SMI interface doesn't exist it will be created by NQPTP.
// The SMI name should be delimited by a space and followed by a command letter.
// At present, the only command is "T", which must followed by nothing or by
// a space and a space-delimited list of IPv4 or IPv6 numbers,
// the whole not to exceed 4096 characters in total.
// The IPs, if provided, will become the new list of timing peers, replacing any
// previous list. If the master clock of the new list is the same as that of the old list,
// the master clock is retained without resynchronisation; this means that non-master
// devices can be added and removed without disturbing the SMI's existing master clock.
// If no timing list is provided, the existing timing list is deleted.
// (In future version of NQPTP the SMI interface may also be deleted at this point.)
// SMI interfaces are not currently deleted or garbage collected.
